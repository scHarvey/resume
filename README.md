## Summary

> With over two decades of experience spanning infrastructure, application development, and enterprise architecture, I bring a systems-level mindset to modern software challenges. My specialty is designing scalable, maintainable, and secure platforms that serve business goals — whether that’s a customer portal, a CRM, or a company-wide integration layer.

> I’ve led projects from startup-scale websites to enterprise CRM migrations, and I thrive at the intersection of technical precision and business clarity. As a remote contributor since 2020, I collaborate fluidly across time zones and partner with vendors, in-house teams, and stakeholders to deliver architecture that lasts.

> I specialize in event-based design, serverless infrastructure, and API-first systems — and I enjoy working through the technical and human factors that make systems succeed.

## Work History

### Solution Architect (10/2017 - Present) @ Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield

> At Wellmark, I’ve led the design and implementation of enterprise systems across multiple business units, including Sales and Customer Service. These systems were built primarily on Microsoft Dynamics 365 and extended with custom development and near real-time AWS-based data integrations.

> My architecture work has focused on enabling flexibility and performance at scale: I introduced message-based integration using AWS SNS/SQS, which eliminated legacy batch jobs and unlocked asynchronous, fault-tolerant communication. I guided our internal developers and consulting partners (Accenture, Cognizant) through complex implementations while ensuring architectural integrity. In parallel, I drove the full rebuild of Wellmark’s customer portal (MyWellmark), re- architecting it into a modern, cloud-based application with an Angular front end, Node APIs, and AWS infrastructure (Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, DynamoDB, RDS). I’m also deeply involved in architecture governance, reusable pattern documentation, and mentorship across the engineering org.

### Lead Application Developer (1/2016 - 6/2017) @ Voce Platforms

> At Voce Platforms, I led web development for digital campaigns by brands like Disney Parks, Madison Square Garden, and Xbox. I architected high-performance WordPress VIP websites tailored for large traffic volumes and interactive design requirements. I also worked directly on technical responses to RFPs and helped scope new engagements, functioning as both lead developer and technical strategist.

### Lead Developer (5/2010 - 1/2016) @ Mittera

> Mittera was where I wore many hats. I built custom CMS platforms, mobile apps, campaign tools, and media experiences for clients like SNHU, Scheels, and the Jeb! 2016 campaign. I architected and deployed projects using PHP, WordPress, custom APIs, and mobile frameworks. I also coached developers, led client discovery sessions, and integrated social APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Parse) to create user-driven, interactive platforms.

### IT Director (7/2002 - 4/2010) @ J.W. Hutton, St. Charles, IA (purchased by United Healthcare)

> As the sole IT lead, I managed infrastructure, purchasing, application development, and database administration for a 50-person insurance services company. I introduced workflow automation, overhauled reporting systems and work intake systems, and migrated legacy Excel and Access systems to more efficient web applications with MSSQL backends — cutting processing times by 90% in key areas.
