## Projects Highlights

### Sept 2016 - Nov 2016 - Waukee APEX Program

> Developed a short curriculum to teach an advanced high school program in Waukee, Iowa, the basics of software development using pseudo code and PHP to help them further customize some of the WordPress themes that they were developing for "clients". Developed the curriculum, hosted on [github](https://github.com/scHarvey/todo) so that students could have a working version of the demo projects that we then built in class, and then taught 3-4 face to face sessions with the class where we worked through lessons and then broke off for individual Q&A so students could see how the lessons applied to their particular project at the time.

### June 2014 - Feb 2016 - Jeb!2016 - WordPress site

> The team at Mittera was brought in to reboot a failed attempt at a campaign website. We worked hand in hand with the campaign digital staff, sometimes onsite in Miami, to build and constantly enhance the Jeb! website. Incorporating a new donation API system, adding a WooCommerce based storefront, and building custom reporting capabilities to fulfill the legal requirement of transparency that go with a national campaign of this scale.

### December 2013 - March 2014 - SAE - Mobile App

> Our team at Mittera built an iOS app for a national fraternity.
>
> We were involved from the beginning with early concepts of possible features and continued through the entire product lifecycle. I helped steer features and then the look and feel of the app and then built a WordPress based CMS to allow new content to be sent to the app. Additionally we leveraged the Parse.com API for user management, in app chat, a photo feed with user controlled content, and push notifications. I built apps into the WordPress system to allow SAE to upload their own images to the stream (like Instagram) and to also compose push notifications without mucking around in the Parse.com back end.

### March 2013 - May 2013 - Principal Charity Classic - Mobile Application

> In addition to help developing the look and feel for the app I was tasked with creating a CMS with an API to allow the client to create and edit content easily and have it seamlessly feed into both an iPhone and an Android application. Leveraging the power of WordPress I created custom post types for each content type and then created a custom template that creates an XML feed in the format expected by both apps. In addition to being able to request all the data in each particular feed you're able to send a "last update date" parameter and only get items that have changed since you last called home. We also use this system to create a Foursquare like checkin service that allows users to announce to other app users that they're at a particular location and then see other users at that location. We also hook into the Facebook API to highlight the user's friends that are checked in.

### March 2012 - September 2012 - [ScheelsSocial - Fish Tales](http://scheelssocial.com)

> Creation of a WordPress based site that is the backend for an in store experiential photo booth powered by an augmented reality iPad app that I oversaw the development of. The WordPress site allows the app to submit new photos as custom posts and creates an Instagram like experience for the users, creating a single image page with social sharing buttons and a personalized message. Two minutes after the photo is submitted an email is sent to the user with a shortened URL to their photo. Another web service was created to allow the iPad to pull down a slideshow of recent images to act as an in store attractor loop.Since the launch of the photo booth in a single store it has averaged over 1000 photos a week, and we are currently working to roll it out to 2 other stores, with more to follow in the following months.

### January 2012 - February 2012 - FollowEDU - Website

> Creation of a WordPress based site that allows users to register their twitter account and see who is influential in various topics that matter to the higher education marketplace.Simple easy to understand user interface and hooks to the twitter API to get recent tweets, twitter followers, and Klout score.

### September 2002 - April 2010 - J.W. Hutton

> Various projects as the sole IT person at a company of 50 employees. Tasks include: installing a new windows 2003 server as both a file/app server and a domain controller, installation of a hardware based firewall to replace an aging linux firewall, purchasing and installation of new client machines to replace dated hardware as needed, consultation on the feasibility of different ideas and partnerships brought to me by the owner of the company, and various other tasks of both an IT Director and a computer tech.
>
> Creation of a web based reporting tool that takes data from a purchased workflow system and translates it into usable reports via mySQL and PHP. Tool includes csv and pdf exporting of reports along side of the PHP generated pages.Recently this app has been updated further to include a new process to batch create PDFs of client reports which are then hosted on an existing site of our client.
>
> Transition of existing web applications from dynamic SQL generated inside of ASP pages to Stored Procedures called from those ASP pages. This enabled us to take one particular job that ran for multiple hours down to a 15 minute process.

### May 2002 - February 2003

> Development of a website to allow users to manage prepaid phone cards. Site is hosted on a Windows server and is built using ASP, C# (.Net) and MSSQL. I was involved in the full development cycle from needs analysis through final implementation and adding of additional features.
